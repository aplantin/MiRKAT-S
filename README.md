# Important Note 

The most up-to-date implementation of the MiRKATS function is available in the R package [MiRKAT](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MiRKAT/index.html), available on CRAN. Please use that version rather than this archived version. 







### Archive 

The R package MiRKATS performs community-level association testing for microbiome data with censored survival outcomes, given an ecologically relevant distance matrix (e.g., the UniFrac distances) or the corresponding kernel matrix. 

To install MiRKATS from an interactive R session: 

  library(devtools) <br/>
  install_github("aplantin/MiRKATS") <br/>
