# MiRKATS

The R package MiRKATS performs community-level association testing for microbiome data with censored survival outcomes, given an ecologically relevant distance matrix (e.g., the UniFrac distances) or the corresponding kernel matrix. 

To install MiRKATS from an interactive R session: 

  library(devtools) <br/>
  install_github("aplantin/MiRKATS") <br/>
  library(MiRKATS) <br/>

The MiRKATS function is also available from R package [MiRKAT](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MiRKAT/index.html), available on CRAN.
